Make your project documentation (or blog, or something else) with Markdown.

#### Demo: [https://petersamokhin.com/markdown-site/demo](https://petersamokhin.com/markdown-site/demo?github-readme)

## Features
- HTML-generating on-the-fly from the Markdown files.
- Generating of navigation on-the-fly.
- Dynamic permissions management:
  * Each user has a list of roles (roles are like GitHub's organization's groups).
  * Each page and directory should have a list of roles.
  * User can see the page (in navigation too) if he has at least one role from page's list.
- Search on all pages depending on access rights of current user.
- Preview of result html page in creating page.
- All settings and access rights are fully configurable (using admin panel or changing the code).
- Too easy to add new setting — admin panel is generated too. You simply need to add new setting and default value, and then you will be able to configure it in admin panel.
- You can simply copy your markdown files to `views/pages/` and (if it necessary) manage access to paths — and then your documentation is ready :) All new pages and directories will be indexed at next page loading.
- Nice looking & adaptive design for all screen sizes.
- Other small but useful features:
  - Each header has `#link` to it
  - Most code snippets will have copy button on header above
  - You can use all `kramdown` features
  - `Main pages folder` from configuration will be always on top in navigation on each page.
  - Pages will have default access rights from config and will be placed in `Main pages folder` if you wont specify path or roles.
  - Advanced error handling (page with information about error will be shown for each error, so no crashes must occur)
